EXPENSE MANAGER performs all the basic functions of expense tracking and finance management which ensures users to keep a track of their financial transactions without breaking a sweat.
To suit various user groups this application is equipped with the feature of Multiple Tracking Modes which makes different tracking methods available to the users according to their needs.
The available tracking modes are:

•	Daily Expense Tracking (DET) Mode || This mode tracks your expenses on a daily expenditure basis. It is for the procrastinators among us, with the least efforts you could get the desired results.

•	Rigorous Expense Tracking (RET) Mode || This mode tracks your expense on the basis of the expenditure made on particular items & instances. This ensures that the application can track the expense to the fullest of its capability and generate a more vivid report, with much more detail.

Also, this application comes with a very well designed and easy to use User Interface (UI), which makes tracking of expenses easier and faster.
In addition to that it has a profile creation feature i.e. a user can maintain multiple accounts on the same device and this also enhances security.

P.s. This app is still in the Beta phase and updates will be rolling out soon to fix any bugs found. We hope this application proves useful and is able to help the user manage their expenditure.
Feedback will be highly appreciated.
